<p style="font-size:35px">Social
<p> Our societyâ€™s social structure built on a hierarchy that consists of a king, nobles, wealthy citizens, poor citizens, and the slaves/prisoners of war, similar to the hierarchy of Ancient Egypt. 1% of the population is the king and his family. 9% of the population are the nobles that advise the king based on the voice of the people. 20% of the population are wealthy citizens that work as artisans and merchants. 50% of the population are poor citizens that work as miners oxr soldiers. 20% of the population are slaves. Our civilization is monotheistic and believes in a God named Shalamba, similar to modern Christianity. We give great praise and follow the ways of our messiah Kennai, also similar to how modern-day Christianity believes in Jesus. Our people follow the laws and teachings of our god and king in order to achieve eternal life. Our king has nobles that represent the poor and rich citizens and tell him what changes they want to be done to the island. Our civilization follows the ancient Chinese philosophy of Legalism, meaning we have adhered to a strict formula of laws and punishments so that citizens are kept in check. Shalamba gave laws to the people of the island to follow, similar to the Ten Commandments.
<ol>
    <li>You will not kill your fellow man</li>
	<li> You will respect and love your neighbor</li>
	<li> Do not steal from fellow citizens</li>
	<li> Live and die for your God and country</li>
	<li> Respect the authorities</li>
	<li> Never disrespect Shalamba</li>
</ol>	
<p> These are the laws Shalamba put in place, while some lesser laws were written by judges. If you break minor laws you will be flogged for 20 minutes. If you break the Creed of Shalamba, you will be hanged. If you break the 6th law of Shalamba, you are beaten and sent out to sea on a raft. When you are accused of a crime you are judged and prosecuted by nobles. All men serve in the military. for a period of 4 years in order to receive citizenship.
