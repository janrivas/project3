<p style="font-size:100px">Political
<p> Our islands are ruled by a monarchy, and we also believe in the philosophy of legalism. Our king is the executive power of our islands. Nobles come up with new laws, can judge and prosecute criminals, and make reports to the king about the people, similar to how nobles were advisers to the pharaoh in ancient Egypt. Our civilization only gives citizenship to those who are born on the island and serve in the military for 4 years, somewhat like the Agoge of Sparta. However, we do give business citizenships to individuals who bring trade to our civilization. Our major laws are:
<ol>
	<li>You will not kill your fellow man.</li>
	<li>You will respect and love your neighbor.</li>
	<li>Do not steal from fellow citizens.</li>
	<li>Live and die for your God and country.</li>
	<li>Respect your authority.</li>
	<li>Never disrespect Shalamba.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other laws that have been written by nobles, but these laws are really based on the basic idea of right and wrong. Any crime can be brought to nobles, who will evaluate the situation and make a judgment based on these ideas. Ancient Egypt had a similar sort of system where nobles made judgments based on the basic idea of right and wrong. Our people have the right to express themselves as long as you donâ€™t commit blasphemy or disrespect Shalamba in any way. Our people are responsible for our trade and the defense of the island. Civilians can talk to their local noble if they have an issue or complaint.
