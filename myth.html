<center><h1>Civilzation Myth</h1></center>
<center><p> 
In the beginning of time, there was a god named Shalamba who was created out of specs of electrons, neutrons, and protons, who created the universes and the galaxies by using his two hands and clapped. Shalamba had an idea to enslave humans but then he realized he would be a very harsh god so instead he created Mason by dust and the took a deep breath and blew air into Mason's mouth while forming him.Then Shalamba remembered that there had been a problem for Mason to do which was to produce women by grabbing a flower and smashing it into pieces. Then poof, a woman was created and she was named Clarissa. “Clarissa!” Shalamba bellowed. “GO TO MASON AND SLEEP WITH HIM. GO!” So Mason had his back resting against the tree that he was on until Shalamba appeared and told Mason, “Build a house so you can live in it and find food.” Later that day he finished building it and Clarissa came and began to flirt with Mason and then they started doing stuff that started pleasuring themselves. Months later Clarissa stomach started to panic because she thought she had gotten fat. She prayed to Shalamba and then Shalamba came to her in a dream and told her “Hush my child everything is going to be fine just have faith in me and it will be ok.” She woke up and then she realized she should have faith in Shalamba. One morning Clarissa was in pain because she was in labor and cried “AAAWWWWW. AWWWWW” Clarissa cried. Then Mason wakes up and finds that she was going to have a baby. Mason was confused on what to do and had started to panic and ding an idea came to him. He kneeled down on the bed and started to pray to Shalamba and said “Please Shalamba help me out please I’ll do anything.” Then the baby started to come out and Mason got the baby and it was finally over. Shalamba told them to take care of this child and it was a boy. They were both happy of what a blessing the gods were to them. That same moment Mason and Clarissa wanted to create a name for the boy but then instead they kneed down and prayed to Shalamba saying “Oh Great Shalamba with our honor and dignity what should our child be called with your glorious name?” Shalamba replied “ Charlie!” with a grasp voice.
