<p style="font-size:100px">Economics
<p style = "font-size:40px">The jobs in our civilization are miners, merchants, artisans, and soldiers. Since we have a lot of iron in our civilization to trade with other territories. We get crops from trading with Territory 4. Other than that, we mainly eat fish from our rivers and hunt in our forests. We store half of the crops we earn from trade in the statue of Kennai in a case of crisis. The rest are sold in our marketplace. Our currency is based on the weight of our iron coins. We made a harbor so other territories can trade with us safely. We write on stone tablets. Part of our deal with Territory 4 is that our rich can go to their schools for a better education. Rich citizens usually have the job of merchant or artisan because of their higher education. Merchants are masters at trading and travel to different territories to trade for the islands. Poor citizens jobs are miners and soldiers. We tax the rich and poor for money, but we tax the poor less because they are the backbone of our society.</p>
