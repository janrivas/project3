<mark>Our civilization is monotheistic.</mark> We believe in one god named Shalamba. The name of our religion is the Creed of Shalamba. Our king is our religious leader he is a descendant from our messiah Kennai. Our king is second when it comes to praising from the citizens. From trading and traveling the philosophy of legalism found its way to our civilization. The citizens believe that Shalamba placed strict laws over them so they don’t get out of control like their ancestors. In the summer we have a month long festival called Shamboree. Citizens celebrate Shalamba during this festival with lots of drinking and parties. Laws are less strict during these festivities. We also have Founder's day where citizens celebrate Kennai’s discovery of the islands by having a week long fast and daily prayer to Kennai and Shalamba.</p>
